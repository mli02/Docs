## Recovery Assessment -- Morning Tests

Perform these upon waking to determine readiness to train.

### 1. Grip Strength Test
- Squeeze a grip dynamometer or bathroom floor scale first thing in the morning
- Establish baseline when well-rested
- **10-20% decline = not recovered** -- consider a lighter day or rest
- Reflects overall upper-to-lower motor neuron pathway integrity, not just hand fatigue

### 2. Carbon Dioxide Tolerance Test (CO2 Discard Rate)
**Protocol:**
1. Inhale deeply through nose, exhale fully -- repeat 4 times
2. 5th inhale: fill lungs maximally (push stomach out, engage diaphragm)
3. Start timer
4. Exhale as slowly as possible through mouth (tiny straw breathing)
5. Stop timer when you can no longer exhale (don't sit with empty lungs)

**Interpretation:**
| CO2 Time | Status |
|---|---|
| <20-25 sec | NOT recovered -- nervous system still fatigued |
| 30-60 sec | Green zone -- ready for physical work |
| 65-120 sec | Fully recovered, prepared for high output |

Track daily over time for objective trending.

### 3. Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
- Good metric but harder to measure than the above two
- Higher HRV = better recovery state
- Be consistent: always test under same conditions (morning, before stimulants)

### Additional Tests (Galpin)
- **Vertical jump** (daily force plate or vertical leap test)
- **Tap test** (finger taps per minute; CNS readiness)
- **Resting morning pulse rate**

## Cold Exposure

### Post-Hypertrophy Training: AVOID
- **Do NOT do cold water immersion immediately after hypertrophy training**
- Estimated ~10%+ attenuation of hypertrophy gains
- Interferes with mTOR pathway and other inflammation-dependent pathways essential for muscle repair and growth
- Wait at least **4 hours** if possible (signaling cascade completes by then)
- Cold showers are probably fine (much weaker stimulus than immersion)

### Post-Strength Training
- Less clear interference than hypertrophy
- Still best to wait a few hours

### Post-Endurance Training
- Some data suggest cold immersion may **enhance** mitochondrial biogenesis
- Less concern about interference; potentially complementary

### Best Practices for Cold Exposure
- Do it on **off days**, or in the **morning before training**
- Morning cold: HRV drops acutely, then rebounds **higher** than baseline over 1-3 hours = net parasympathetic benefit
- Protocol: 1-3 min immersion at 30-50 deg F
- Break the thermal layer (move limbs / circulate water)
- 60 deg F with whirlpool jet > 35 deg F sitting still

---

## Heat Exposure

### Post-Training
- Heat immediately after hypertrophy training may **augment** hypertrophy (increased blood flow, nutrient delivery, waste removal)
- Dry sauna preferred; hot bath is a weaker alternative
- Also beneficial after endurance training

### General Health
- Sauna is clearly beneficial for health outcomes
- NOT a substitute for exercise

### Hydration Warning
- Sauna at 200+ deg F for 20 min: expect 3+ lbs fluid loss
- Must replace 125-150% of lost fluid

## NSAIDs -- Avoid Around Training

- Ibuprofen, aspirin, naproxen, etc.
- **Avoid within 4 hours before AND 4 hours after exercise**
- Blunts gains in endurance, strength, and muscle size
- The adaptations training creates depend on inflammatory signaling that NSAIDs suppress

---

## Post-Workout Down-Regulation Breathing (CRITICAL -- Galpin)

- **5 minutes of exhale-emphasized breathing immediately post-workout**
- Minimum: 3 minutes (can do in the shower)
- Methods:
  - Double exhale: 4-sec inhale, 8-sec exhale
  - Box breathing: 4-sec inhale, 4-sec hold, 4-sec exhale, 4-sec hold
  - Physiological sighs
- Lie on back if possible; dim light; close eyes
- Benefits:
  - Faster workout-to-workout recovery
  - Elimination of energy crash 3-4 hours post-workout
  - Prevents lingering sympathetic state from undermining rest of day

## Galpin's 3-Phase Recovery Model

### Phase 1: Inflammation (seconds to hours post-training)
- **DO NOT suppress inflammation** immediately -- it IS the adaptation signal
- No ice, no NSAIDs, no antioxidants immediately post-training
- Omega-3s are acceptable (2-5g EPA+DHA, 1:1 ratio; do NOT exceed 15g)

### Phase 2: Proliferation (cleanup/debris clearing)
- Glutamine: 20g/day (10g morning + 10g night)

### Phase 3: Remodeling (tissue repair and growth)
- Protein: 1g/lb body weight minimum
- Both protein and carbohydrate stimulate insulin (anabolic)
- Micronutrients: multivitamin, vitamin A, zinc, magnesium, calcium, vitamin D
- Tart cherry juice/extract for soreness + sleep

## Sleep

### Why It Matters for Weightlifters
- Deep sleep supports gonadal function (Leydig cells produce testosterone)
- Poor sleep elevates cortisol, which shunts cholesterol precursors AWAY from testosterone/estrogen production
- Sleep apnea is strongly associated with lower testosterone

### Behavioral Protocols
- **Nasal breathing day and night** -- increases O2, offloads CO2, reduces apnea, indirectly raises testosterone
- **Bright light (2-10 min) within first hour of waking** -- sunlight ideal; no sunglasses
  - Drives dopamine --> LH/FSH --> testosterone/estrogen
- **Avoid bright light in the middle of the night** -- suppresses dopamine, suppresses testosterone
- Mouth taping or nasal dilators for snoring/mouth breathing
- Only two things happen in the bed: sex and sleep

### Sleep Environment (Galpin)
- Wash sheets weekly (allergen accumulation)
- Keep pets out of bedroom (dander)
- Monitor CO2 buildup -- closed rooms with poor ventilation disrupt sleep stages
- Cold room is important; delivery method matters
- Phone: night mode / DND / black-and-white screen overnight

### Sleep Supplements
- Magnesium threonate
- L-Theanine (caution: sleepwalking in some)
- Apigenin
- Myo-inositol: 900 mg before bed
- Tart cherry extract
- Melatonin: only third-party tested sources (quality control is terrible)

## The Adaptation vs. Optimization Paradigm (Galpin)

### Adaptation Phase (off-season, building)
- Tolerate stress, avoid blunting signals
- Less recovery modalities (no ice baths after lifting)
- Let inflammation do its job

### Optimization Phase (in-season, peaking/competing)
- Maximize recovery using all tools aggressively
- Ice, cold, compression, etc. are all fair game
- Adaptation is not the goal; performance is

---

## Stress-Recovery Framework

- Total stress (visible + hidden) must not outpace recovery capacity
- **"Performance anchors"** -- identify the 2-3 things dragging you down and remove them FIRST
- Take foot off the brake before hitting the gas

---

## Injury / Pain Management

- No good or bad exercises -- only good or bad application
- Injury comes from: bad position, too much volume, too much intensity, too much complexity
- If something hurts: reduce complexity, load, and volume -- train just BELOW pain threshold
- Two mechanisms of rehab: tissue tolerance building + pain desensitization
- Stopping movement entirely rarely fixes the problem

---

## Devices / Feedback Caution

- Sleep trackers measure correlates (HR, breathing), not sleep directly
- Subjective belief about recovery affects performance (placebo/nocebo from sleep scores)
- Orthosomnia: do not check sleep tracker for at least 60 min after waking
- Understand what your device measures before letting it dictate training
