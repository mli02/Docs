## Priority Hierarchy (for body composition)

1. **Sleep** -- the foundation of everything
2. **Resistance training** -- the most powerful lever for body composition
3. **Total daily protein** -- the #1 nutritional priority
4. **Total daily calories** -- surplus, deficit, or maintenance depending on goal
5. **Protein distribution/timing** -- a very distant secondary concern
6. **Macronutrient composition (carbs vs. fats)** -- no meaningful difference when protein and calories are equated
7. **Specific food choices and supplements** -- the fine details

## Protein

### Daily Targets
- **Minimum for muscle gains:** 1.6 g/kg (0.7 g/lb) per day
- **General recommendation:** 0.7-1.0 g/lb per day
- **Recomposition / recovery:** 1.0-1.5 g/lb per day
- **Galpin's rule:** 1 g/lb body weight, especially during recovery/remodeling

### Per-Meal Dose (to maximize muscle protein synthesis)
- **Optimal: 0.4-0.6 g/kg per meal** (~0.2-0.25 g/lb)
- The "30g protein cap" is a myth:
  - With full-body training (24+ sets), 40g > 20g for MPS (McNaughton et al.)
  - 100g milk protein post-exercise > 25g for MPS (Trommelen et al.)
  - Higher doses are fully utilized for other metabolic needs

### Leucine
- **700-3,000 mg per meal** is important for muscle growth
- The key essential amino acid driving MPS
- Preferably from whole food sources

### Protein Quality
- Gram for gram, animal proteins are superior (higher EAA content, more leucine)
- However, when total daily protein is equated at 1.6+ g/kg with proper training, vegan vs. omnivore groups show **no significant difference** in muscle/strength gains
- Soy protein is legitimately high quality; whey still has a slight edge
- Mycoprotein (Quorn) matched omnivore groups in a 12-week trial

### Why Protein Is Critical
1. Directly supports lean body mass and skeletal muscle
2. Most satiating macronutrient -- suppresses hunger
3. Highest thermic effect -- most calorically expensive to process

## Meal Frequency & Timing

### The "Anabolic Window" Is Overblown
- As long as total daily protein is at least 0.7 g/lb, timing relative to training makes **no significant difference** (Aragon & Schoenfeld meta-analysis)
- A mixed meal's anabolic/anti-catabolic effect lasts **3-6 hours**
- MPS peaks 24 hours post-training, stays elevated 48-72 hours
- The real "anabolic window" is days, not minutes
- **Rule of thumb (Aragon):** "If you're burping your pre-exercise meal at the end of your workout, you don't need to rush to eat post-workout"

### Practical Takeaway
- Eat 2-4 times per day
- Hit total daily protein at each meal
- If you ate within 3-6 hours before training, post-workout timing is not critical
- If genuinely fasted (8-10+ hours), get protein in sooner after training

### Carbohydrate Timing DOES Matter More Than Protein Timing
- Carbs should be available around training for glycogen resynthesis
- Especially important if training daily or multiple times per day
- If training every 2-3 days, carb timing is less critical (glycogen restores easily)

---

## Peri-Workout Nutrition (Galpin Framework)

### Combined Pre + During + Post Targets
- **Carbs:** ~0.5 g/lb body weight (scale down for easy sessions, up for hard/long)
- **Protein:** ~0.25 g/lb body weight
- Can be distributed before, during, or after -- flexibility exists

### Intra-Workout Carbs (Sessions >2 hours or extremely high intensity)
- **60-100g carbs per hour** (~20g per 15-20 min interval)
- Target 5-9% glucose concentration in fluid
- Use glucose AND fructose at **2-3:1 ratio** (separate transporters maximize absorption)
- Sources: honey, coconut water, specialized products

### Fasted Training
- Fine if glycogen stores are topped off from the day before
- Caffeine works better (feels more potent) when fasted
- For high intensity or long duration: fueling before or during is necessary

## Body Recomposition (Gaining Muscle + Losing Fat Simultaneously)

At least a dozen studies confirm this is possible.

### Protocol
- **Caloric surplus:** ~10% above maintenance (~200-300 cal above)
- **Protein:** 1.0-1.5 g/lb per day (the common thread in recomp studies)
- **Training:** Resistance training 3-4x/week with meaningful effort plus cardio
- The extra calories should come from quality protein

### Protein Overfeeding Studies (Antonio et al.)
- Adding 400-800 extra cal/day purely from protein on top of habitual diet
- With resistance training: nobody gained fat, some lost fat
- At 2g/lb for 8 weeks: subjects sweated during sleep (thermic effect)
- **Key caveat:** without exercise, protein surplus still adds fat (Bray et al.)

---

## Fasted vs. Fed Training (for Fat Loss)

- Fasted training burns more fat **during** the session
- Over 24 hours with equated nutrition, fat oxidation **evens out**
- No difference in body fat reduction between fasted and fed groups (Schoenfeld & Aragon)
- No lean mass loss in fasted cardio group
- **Choose based on preference.** Total daily calories and protein are what matter.

---

## Carbohydrates & Fat Loss

- When calories and protein are equated, **no significant difference** between high-carb and low-carb diets in any well-controlled trial
- Keto only "wins" when protein is NOT equated and/or because it reduces caloric intake via food variety restriction
- **Hyperpalatability is the real enemy:** refined carbs + fat + salt/sweetness drives overconsumption

---

## Dietary Fats

### Seed Oils: Overvilified
- Scientific consensus does not support seed oil fear
- Canola oil outperformed olive oil for blood lipid improvements in meta-analyses
- The real issue: seed oils are associated with ultra-processed junk food

### Saturated Fat
- Don't drop to zero (dry skin, brittle hair, achy joints, reduced testosterone)
- Low to moderate intake from red meat, eggs, some butter is reasonable
- Supports cholesterol and testosterone levels for natural lifters

### Government Guideline (reasonable variety)
- 30% calories from fat: 10% saturated, 10% monounsaturated, 10% polyunsaturated

---

## Hydration

### Daily Baseline (Galpin)
- **Body weight (lbs) / 2 = daily fluid oz** (NOT including exercise)
- Example: 200 lbs = 100 oz/day
- Coffee/tea counts toward total

### The "Galpin Equation" -- During Exercise
- **Body weight (lbs) / 30 = oz every 15-20 minutes**
- Example: 200 lbs = ~6-7 oz every 15-20 min
- Sip slowly; do not gulp

### Post-Workout
- Replace **125-150%** of fluid lost during exercise
- Weigh naked before/after; difference = fluid lost

### Intra-Workout Fluid Composition
- Don't drink only plain water during training
- Target: **200-400 mg sodium** per serving
- Sodium-to-potassium ratio: roughly **2-3:1**

### Electrolytes
- People eating clean, exercising, drinking caffeine, eating lower carb are likely **under-salted**
- **500 mg sodium pre-workout; 500 mg post-workout** (general rule)
- High sodium sweaters: 750 mg pre/post + 300 mg during

### Over-Hydration Warning
- Hyponatremia (diluted blood sodium) symptoms mimic dehydration
- Can be fatal in extreme cases

### Sleep Hydration
- Reduce fluid intake in the 3 hours before sleep to sipping as needed

## During Injury / Heavy Recovery (Galpin)

- **Increase total calories by ~10%** -- injury raises BMR up to 10%
- Do NOT cut calories just because you're training less
- Maintain protein at 1g/lb or higher
- Maintain carbs and fat at normal levels

---

## Sugar & Sweeteners (Aragon)

- Limit added sugars to **10% of total calories** (~40-50g max on 2,000 cal)
- **Stevia:** safest, hardest to find negatives; some evidence of benefits
- **Aspartame, sucralose:** amounts needed to cause harm are absurd at normal intake
- **Diet sodas:** controlled trials show positive effects on weight loss
- **Saccharine:** the problematic one (gut microbiome disruption); nearly extinct commercially

---

## Caffeine

- **Dose:** 1-3 mg/kg body weight, ~30 min before training (Galpin)
- Above 5 mg/kg: performance **decrements** begin
- Strongest for endurance; also enhances reaction time, focus
- Coffee health benefits cut off at 3-4 cups/day
- Tolerance: habituated users still see ergogenic benefit
- If not training first thing: delay caffeine 90-120 min after waking

---

## Alcohol

- Causes disinhibition (overconsumption), contains significant calories (~1,000 cal/day for moderate drinker)
- Disrupts sleep architecture (reduces REM and deep sleep), impairing recovery
- Very few people with impressive physiques are regular significant drinkers
- Red wine specifically has the most positive literature (anti-cancer, neuropsych improvements)

---

## Collagen (Aragon: Take It)

- **15g/day**
- Most abundant protein in the body (80% of skin by dry weight)
- Collagen peptides resist full hydrolysis, reach target tissues, increase chondrocyte activity
- **Combine with vitamin C** for synergy
- Do NOT count collagen toward daily protein target for muscle-building (low leucine)
- Downside risk is essentially non-existent

## Myths Debunked

1. **"30g protein cap per meal"** -- FALSE. Higher doses (40-100g) show greater MPS with training stimulus.
2. **"Must eat within 30-60 min post-workout"** -- FALSE. Total daily protein matters far more.
3. **"Fasted cardio burns more fat"** -- MISLEADING. Evens out over 24 hours.
4. **"Fasted training eats muscle"** -- FALSE.
5. **"Need caloric deficit to lose fat"** -- NOT ALWAYS. Recomp works with high protein + training.
6. **"Seed oils are toxic"** -- NOT SUPPORTED by evidence.
7. **"Keto is superior for fat loss"** -- Only when protein/calories aren't equated.
8. **"Plant proteins can't build muscle"** -- FALSE at adequate total daily protein.
9. **"Collagen is useless"** -- FALSE. Collagen peptides reach target tissues.
