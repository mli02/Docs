## Neuromuscular Fundamentals

- **Henneman Size Principle:** Motor units recruit from low-threshold to high-threshold. Heavy weights are NOT the only way to recruit high-threshold motor units -- sustained effort at moderate loads also recruits them over time.
- **Mind-muscle connection matters:** Your ability to voluntarily isolate and contract a specific muscle directly predicts your capacity to stimulate hypertrophy. Test by trying to "cramp" individual muscles outside the gym.
- **Strength vs. hypertrophy distinction:**
  - Strength = moving progressively greater loads; musculature as a system
  - Hypertrophy = isolating specific nerve-to-muscle pathways; hard, localized contractions

## Strength Training

### The "3-to-5" Framework (Galpin)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Intensity | >85% 1RM |
| Reps per set | 1-5 (typically 3-5) |
| Sets per exercise | 3-5 working sets |
| Rest between sets | 2-5+ minutes (up to 7 min for maximal singles) |
| Exercises per session | 3-5 |
| Frequency | 2x/week minimum per muscle group; can be daily |
| Sessions per week | 3-5 |

- Strength adaptation is driven by **intensity, NOT volume**
- Early adaptations (~first 4 weeks) are primarily nervous system changes
- Strength can increase without muscle size increase
- Because tissue damage is low, frequency can be very high (pro strength athletes squat daily)
- **Intent matters:** The *intent* to move fast is more important than actual bar speed for strength/power development

### Power Training
- Same 3-to-5 framework as strength
- **Load: 40-70% 1RM** with emphasis on maximum movement velocity

### Explosiveness
- **60-75% of 1RM**, move as quickly as possible in a controlled manner
- Do NOT go to failure (speed degrades near failure)

---

## Hypertrophy Training

### Primary Driver: VOLUME (taken to or near failure)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Intensity | 30-80% 1RM (wide range works) |
| Optimal rep range | 8-30 per set (5-30 all effective if near failure) |
| Sets per muscle group/week (maintain) | 5 sets minimum |
| Sets per muscle group/week (grow) | 10-20 sets |
| Sets per muscle group/week (advanced) | 20-25 sets |
| Rest between sets | 2-6 min for hypertrophy/strength |
| Frequency | Every 48-72 hours per muscle group; minimum 2x/week |

### Failure Training
- Only **~10% of total sets** should go to true muscular failure
- Remaining ~90% stop short of failure
- Reason: staying short of failure allows greater total volume, the primary growth driver

### Three Drivers of Hypertrophy (Galpin)
1. **Mechanical tension** -- heavy load, high force
2. **Metabolic stress** -- the burn, pump, blood flow restriction
3. **Muscular damage** -- micro-disruption (more is NOT better)

### The 3-3-3 Self-Assessment (per target muscle)
1. Did you **feel the muscle contracting** during the exercise? (aim for 3/10+)
2. Did you get a **pump** during/after? (aim for 3/10+)
3. Were you **slightly sore** the next day? (aim for 3/10+, NOT 7-10)

If all three are near zero, the exercise execution is wrong or other muscles are compensating.

### Soreness Guidelines
- Target: 3/10 soreness post-workout
- If you can't sit on the couch without pain, you went too far
- Over-soreness = missed training days = lower monthly volume = worse results

---

## Exercise Selection

### Default Rule: All joints through full range of motion across the week
- Larger ROM = better strength and hypertrophy outcomes
- Exception: never compromise spinal position (lumbar stays neutral)

### Movement Pattern Balance (per workout or across week)
- **Upper push** (horizontal: bench; vertical: overhead press)
- **Upper pull** (horizontal: row; vertical: pull-up)
- **Lower push** (squat, lunge, split squat)
- **Lower pull/hinge** (deadlift, RDL, hamstring curl)

A single balanced workout = 4 exercises, one from each category.

### Eccentric Training
- Higher force output = excellent for strength
- Very effective for learning to activate hard-to-recruit muscles
- Progression: eccentric only --> isometric holds --> concentric + eccentric
- Expect more soreness; plan for longer recovery

---

## Endurance / Cardio (for Weightlifters)

### Zone 2 Baseline
- 150-180 min/week of conversational-pace movement
- Prefer concentric-dominant: cycling, swimming, rowing, sled push, uphill walking
- Minimal interference with hypertrophy when volume is moderate
- Nasal-only breathing is a good intensity regulator

### VO2 Max Work (1x/week)
- 2-6 minute work intervals at ~80% max HR
- 1:1 work-to-rest ratio
- 4-8 bouts per session

### Max HR Intervals (1x/week to 2x/month)
- 20-90 second bouts to touch max HR
- 4-8 bouts per session
- Any modality: assault bike, sprints, burpees

### Training Order
- If combining in one session: **lift weights FIRST, then cardio**
- Doing endurance first **decreases testosterone during subsequent lifting**
- On separate days: no negative interaction
- HIIT/sprinting increases testosterone; steady-state >75 min decreases it via cortisol

### Interference Effect
- Zone 2 cardio has **almost NO ability** to block hypertrophy
- May even help via increased blood flow
- Interference mainly when: endurance volume is very high, heavily eccentric (running > cycling), inadequate calories, or insufficient recovery

## Progressive Overload

Non-negotiable. Methods include:
- Adding weight
- Adding reps
- Adding sets
- Reducing rest periods
- Increasing range of motion
- Increasing movement complexity (machine --> free weight --> compound)
- Increasing frequency
- Improving eccentric control / tempo

---

## Warm-Up (for Strength Training)

Classic ramp for working sets at 85% 1RM:
1. Set of 10 at 50%
2. Set of 8 at 60%
3. Set of 8 at 70%
4. Set of 5 at 75%
5. Begin working sets at 85%+

---

## Testosterone-Optimizing Training Protocol (Huberman/French)

- **Heavy weight training NOT to failure** produces the greatest testosterone increases
- Optimal: 1RM to 6-8 rep range, where completion is still possible
- Rest: strictly **2 minutes** between sets
- Testosterone elevation lasts ~24-48 hours post-session
- HIIT/sprinting also increases testosterone

---

## Core Bracing (Galpin)

- Goal: 360-degree cylindrical brace around the spine (front, sides, AND back)
- Target: ~20% core activation maintained while breathing normally
- Belt use: slightly loose belt provides proprioceptive feedback (not so tight it does the work)
- Separate breath from brace -- you must be able to maintain brace while breathing

---

## Breathing During Training

- Heavy singles: hold breath + brace (no breathing needed)
- Multiple reps (3-8+): breathe roughly every 3rd rep; reset, re-brace
- General: hold breath during eccentric/dangerous phase; exhale during last half of concentric
- Between sets: deliberate down-regulation breathing

---

## Deload / Taper Protocol (Galpin)

- **~1 week deload per 8 weeks** of hard training
- **Reduce volume by ~50%**
- **Maintain intensity** (intensity is not the primary driver of fatigue)
- **Maintain training frequency**
- Expected: 3-8% performance improvement within days
- Fast-twitch fibers may actually increase ~10% in size during taper
