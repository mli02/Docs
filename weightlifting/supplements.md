# Supplementation for High-Performance Weightlifting

Synthesized from: Huberman Lab (Testosterone & Estrogen, Muscle & Strength), Alan Aragon, Dr. Andy Galpin

---

## Galpin's 80/20 Rule -- Pick One From Each Category

1. **Fuel:** Creatine monohydrate
2. **Stimulant:** Caffeine (or beetroot juice if training at night)
3. **Fatigue Blocker:** Beta-alanine (or sodium bicarbonate)

---

## Tier 1: Foundation (Everyone Should Take)

### Creatine Monohydrate -- "The Michael Jordan of Supplementation"
- **Dose:** 5g/day (~180 lb person; scale with body weight)
- **Timing:** Any time of day; co-ingestion with carbs enhances uptake
- **Loading phase:** Unnecessary. Standard dosing saturates in 3-4 weeks.
- **Must be taken consistently** -- not an acute-response supplement
- **Benefits:**
  - Power output increase of 12-20% (66 studies)
  - Muscle performance, strength, power
  - Improved cellular hydration
  - Reduced fatigue
  - Bone mineral density
  - Cognitive function (prefrontal cortex fuel)
  - Ameliorates cognitive decline from sleep deprivation
  - Potential neuroprotective effects
- **Side effects:** Essentially none at recommended doses

### Electrolytes (Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium)
- **Sodium is critical** -- neurons fire via sodium ion influx; insufficient salt = poor nerve-to-muscle signaling
- **500 mg sodium pre-workout; 500 mg post-workout**
- High sodium sweaters: 750 mg pre/post + 300 mg during
- Adjust for water intake, caffeine use, sweat rate, temperature

### Vitamin D3
- **4,000-5,000 IU/day** (Aragon takes 4,000 IU)
- Critical for endocrine function and testosterone production
- Benefits cut off below 1,000 IU in literature

### Magnesium
- **Magnesium citrate** (most research) or glycinate
- Avoid magnesium oxide (low bioavailability)
- Supports testosterone production, sleep, recovery

### Zinc
- Supports testosterone production
- Usually covered by a quality multivitamin

### Fish Oil (Omega-3)
- **~1g combined EPA/DHA per day** (Aragon: 3 x 1g capsules)
- For recovery: 2-5g total EPA+DHA, roughly 1:1 ratio (Galpin)
- **Do NOT exceed 15g** -- evidence shows harm to immune response
- Avoid going much above 1g combined EPA/DHA due to atrial fibrillation concerns

### Multivitamin
- "No-brainer" -- almost nobody nails all micronutrients from food alone
- Especially important when dieting or training hard

---

## Tier 2: Performance Enhancers

### Caffeine
- **Dose:** 1-3 mg/kg body weight, ~30 min before training
- Above 5 mg/kg: performance decrements begin
- Strongest for endurance; also enhances reaction time, focus
- If not training first thing: delay 90-120 min after waking
- Caffeine tablets (100-200 mg) offer most precise dosing

### Beta-Alanine
- Builds carnosine in muscle (intracellular acid buffer)
- **Must be taken consistently** to build stores (like creatine)
- **Starting dose:** 2g/day, ramp up by 1g/week to target 5-6g/day
- Side effect: "ants under skin" tingling; diminishes with tolerance
- Effective for anaerobic / high-lactate training

### Sodium Bicarbonate (Baking Soda)
- Raises blood pH, delays acid buildup, delays fatigue
- **Start with 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon** in water
- Timing: 20-90 min pre-workout (~45 min standard)
- Best for: intervals, circuits, high-rep resistance
- Warning: can cause significant GI distress; start LOW

### Alpha GPC
- **300-600 mg** before hard training (especially weight training)
- Cholinergic agonist; enhances focus/alertness without being a traditional stimulant
- Use ~every 3rd or 4th workout, combined with caffeine
- Reserve for key sessions; not for daily use

### Beetroot Juice / Extract
- Nitric oxide pathway (vasodilation)
- Most consistent NO-boosting supplement
- Best for moderate to long-duration endurance
- Not a stimulant -- won't disrupt sleep
- **Caution:** can exacerbate cold sores (activates arginine pathway)

---

## Tier 3: Hormone Optimization

### Tongkat Ali (Eurycoma Longifolia Jack)
- **Dose: 400-800 mg/day**
- Liberates bound testosterone, increasing **free testosterone**
- Pro-fertility, subtle aphrodisiac, mild anti-estrogen
- Works peripherally (frees bound testosterone)
- Side effects: excessive alertness/insomnia if taken too late

### Fadogia Agrestis
- Increases **luteinizing hormone (LH)**, which increases testosterone
- Works upstream at brain/pituitary level (different mechanism from Tongkat Ali)
- **Side effect profile is poorly documented** -- exercise caution
- Can trigger negative feedback loops if hormones go too high
- Get blood work done

### Rhodiola Rosea
- Fatigue reducer / adaptogen
- Meta-analyses show slight improvement in power, fatigue resistance, endurance
- **Caution:** cortisol suppression is NOT always good; if cortisol is already low, rhodiola can make it worse
- Quality/sourcing is a major issue; get single-ingredient, third-party tested

## Tier 4: Recovery & Connective Tissue

### Collagen
- **15g/day** (Aragon)
- For connective tissue, joints, skin
- Combine with vitamin C for synergy
- Do NOT count toward daily protein target for muscle-building (low leucine)

### Vitamin C
- **1g/day** -- immunity + synergy with collagen

### Glutamine (Galpin)
- **20g/day** split into 10g morning + 10g night
- Conditional amino acid for muscle recovery
- Also useful for leaky gut support
- May reduce sugar cravings (~1 tsp in water, 2x/day)

### Curcumin (Galpin)
- **500 mg, 3x/day** (1,500 mg total)
- **WARNING:** Potently reduces DHT in some individuals -- can flatten libido, drive, power output
- Effects reverse after cessation; try empirically

### Tart Cherry Juice/Extract
- Effective for muscle soreness AND may aid sleep

---

## Tier 5: Sleep Stack

### Huberman/Galpin Sleep Supplements
- **Magnesium threonate (Mag3n8)** -- promotes deep sleep
- **L-Theanine** -- sleep onset (caution: can cause sleepwalking/vivid dreams in some)
- **Apigenin** -- sleep onset
- **Myo-inositol: 900 mg** before bed
  - Especially useful for: falling back asleep after waking; sleeping on low-carb; sleeping when fasting before bed
- **Tart cherry extract** -- sleep-promoting + anti-soreness
- **Melatonin:** Use with extreme caution -- supplements measured at 500-5000x labeled dose; only from third-party tested sources

## Supplement Philosophy (Galpin)

- Use **single-ingredient supplements** for 80%+ of your protocol
  - Allows you to identify what works, adjust doses, cycle on/off
  - Blends often under-dose expensive ingredients and over-dose cheap ones
- **Third-party testing** is mandatory for drug-tested athletes, recommended for everyone
- Goal: create physiological resilience that requires no supplementation
- Use supplements as tactical tools while fixing root causes
- Do not mask signals (chronic fatigue, poor sleep, low hormones) with supplements

---

## Post-Training Supplement Timing Warning

- **Do NOT take anti-inflammatories** immediately post-exercise -- inflammation IS the adaptation signal
- **NSAIDs (ibuprofen, aspirin, etc.):** Avoid within **4 hours before AND 4 hours after** exercise -- blunts gains in endurance, strength, and size

---

## Blood Work (Critical)

When modulating hormones, monitor:
- **Testosterone (total and free), DHT, estradiol, LH, FSH**
- **Cortisol, prolactin**
- **Aromatase activity**
- Necessary for safety and to verify interventions are working
- Negative feedback loops mean blindly increasing one hormone can suppress others
